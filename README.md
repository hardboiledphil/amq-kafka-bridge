# amq-kafka-bridge

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Purpose of this repo

This Quarkus app is created just to test a flow that includes the transfer of messages
from Kafka to AMQ or the reverse.

It's not intended to run in dev mode - just ./mvnw clean test

I haven't taken the build through to the build/deploy stage here but I will in a similar
piece of work at work and will feed back any findings from that application that will
end up in production
